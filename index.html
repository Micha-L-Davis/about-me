                Micha Davis is often said to be two small children in a trenchcoat, though this has proven to be false during rare beach sightings. The truth is, Micha is an individual with the imagination (and appetite for snacks) of <em>three</em>, small children. Thanks to being a military brat as a child and a Soldier as a young adult, Micha can't really claim to be <em>from</em> anywhere specific, though she now calls Seattle home. She lives with her spouse, her precocious daughter, and a surly tabby tomcat on a big hill with a view of the mountains.

                Micha studied fine art with a focus in comic art at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design. She wrote, penciled, inked and colored the webcomic <a href="http://luluandmuffin.com" target="_blank">Lulu & Muffin</a>, and also did a bunch of other artsy stuff besides. Although her stylus skills are mighty, her military career left Micha's wrists in a slowly deteriorating state. In 2019 she closed her art studio and turned her attention toward creative pursuits that didn't require hours with a stylus and tablet.

                Pivoting from art to video game development, Micha entered into a Unity/C# intensive program. During this program, Micha released four <a href="http://m-l-davis.com">short games</a> and a few enterprise software demos. This success spurred her onward to seek out training in full-stack developent and turn making software into her new career.
