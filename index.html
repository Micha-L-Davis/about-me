                Micha Davis is often said to be two small children in a trenchcoat, though this has proven to be false during rare beach sightings. The truth is, Micha is an individual with the imagination (and appetite for snacks) of three small children. Thanks to being a military brat as a child and a Soldier as a young adult, Micha can't really claim to be <em>from</em> anywhere specificic, though she now calls Seattle home. She lives with her spouse, her precocious daughter, and a surly tabby tomcat on a big hill with a view of the mountains.

                Micha studied fine art with a focus in comic art at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design. She wrote, penciled, inked and colored the webcomic <a href="http://luluandmuffin.com">Lulu & Muffin</a>, and also did a bunch of other artsy stuff besides. Although her stylus skills are mighty, her military career left Micha's wrists in a slowly deteriorating state. In 2019 she closed her art studio and turned her attention toward creative pursuits that didn't require hours with a stylus and tablet.

                Pivoting from art to video game development, Micha entered into a Unity/C# intensive program. During this program, Micha released four short games and a few enterprise software demos. This success spurred her onward to seek out training in full-stack developent and turn making software into her new career.
